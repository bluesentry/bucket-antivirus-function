[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/upsidetravel/bucket-antivirus-function.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/upsidetravel/bucket-antivirus-function)

Scan new objects added to any s3 bucket using AWS Lambda. [more details in this post](https://engineering.upside.com/s3-antivirus-scanning-with-lambda-and-clamav-7d33f9c5092e)

## Features

- Easy to install
- Send events from an unlimited number of S3 buckets
- Prevent reading of infected files using S3 bucket policies
- Accesses the end-userâ€™s separate installation of
open source antivirus engine [ClamAV](http://www.clamav.net/)

## How It Works

![architecture-diagram](../master/images/bucket-antivirus-function.png)

- Each time a new object is added to a bucket, S3 invokes the Lambda
function to scan the object
- The function package will download (if needed) current antivirus
definitions from a S3 bucket. Transfer speeds between a S3 bucket and
Lambda are typically faster and more reliable than another source
- The object is scanned for viruses and malware.  Archive files are
extracted and the files inside scanned also
- The objects tags are updated to reflect the result of the scan, CLEAN
or INFECTED, along with the date and time of the scan.
- Object metadata is updated to reflect the result of the scan (optional)
- Metrics are sent to [DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) (optional)
- Scan results are published to a SNS topic (optional) (Optionally choose to only publish INFECTED results)
- Files found to be INFECTED are automatically deleted (optional)

## Installation

### Build from Source

To build all functions and clamav binaries, run `make`.  The build process is completed using
the [Serverless Application Model](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) framework.

### Deployment

Use `sam deploy --guided` to deploy the stack to AWS. The guided deployment will require a list of buckets the function can scan. They should be provided in the following format: `arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/*`

### Publish to Serverless Application Repository

`sam package --template-file template.yaml --output-template-file packaged.yaml --s3-bucket serverless-app-packages`

`sam publish --template packaged.yaml --region <region>`


### S3 Events

Configure scanning of additional buckets by adding a new S3 event to
invoke the Lambda function.  This is done from the properties of any
bucket in the AWS console.

![s3-event](../master/images/s3-event.png)

Note: If configured to update object metadata, events must only be
configured for `PUT` and `POST`. Metadata is immutable, which requires
the function to copy the object over itself with updated metadata. This
can cause a continuous loop of scanning if improperly configured.

## Configuration

Runtime configuration is accomplished using environment variables.  See
the table below for reference.

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AV_DEFINITION_S3_BUCKET | Bucket containing antivirus definition files |  | Yes |
| AV_DEFINITION_S3_PREFIX | Prefix for antivirus definition files | clamav_defs | No |
| AV_DEFINITION_PATH | Path containing files at runtime | /tmp/clamav_defs | No |
| AV_SCAN_START_SNS_ARN | SNS topic ARN to publish notification about start of scan | | No |
| AV_SCAN_START_METADATA | The tag/metadata indicating the start of the scan | av-scan-start | No |
| AV_SIGNATURE_METADATA | The tag/metadata name representing file's AV type | av-signature | No |
| AV_STATUS_CLEAN | The value assigned to clean items inside of tags/metadata | CLEAN | No |
| AV_STATUS_INFECTED | The value assigned to clean items inside of tags/metadata | INFECTED | No |
| AV_STATUS_METADATA | The tag/metadata name representing file's AV status | av-status | No |
| AV_STATUS_SNS_ARN | SNS topic ARN to publish scan results (optional) | | No |
| AV_STATUS_SNS_PUBLISH_CLEAN | Publish AV_STATUS_CLEAN results to AV_STATUS_SNS_ARN | True | No |
| AV_STATUS_SNS_PUBLISH_INFECTED | Publish AV_STATUS_INFECTED results to AV_STATUS_SNS_ARN | True | No |
| AV_TIMESTAMP_METADATA | The tag/metadata name representing file's scan time | av-timestamp | No |
| CLAMAVLIB_PATH | Path to ClamAV library files | ./bin | No |
| CLAMDSCAN_PATH | Path to ClamAV clamdscan binary | ./bin/clamdscan | No |
| FRESHCLAM_PATH | Path to ClamAV freshclam binary | ./bin/freshclam | No |
| DATADOG_API_KEY | API Key for pushing metrics to DataDog (optional) | | No |
| AV_PROCESS_ORIGINAL_VERSION_ONLY | Controls that only original version of an S3 key is processed (if bucket versioning is enabled) | False | No |
| AV_DELETE_INFECTED_FILES | Controls whether infected files should be automatically deleted | False | No |
| EVENT_SOURCE | The source of antivirus scan event "S3" or "SNS" (optional) | S3 | No |

## S3 Bucket Policy Examples

### Deny to download the object if not "CLEAN"

This policy doesn't allow to download the object until:

1. The lambda that run Clam-AV is finished (so the object has a tag)
2. The file is not CLEAN

Please make sure to check cloudtrail for the arn:aws:sts, just find the event open it and copy the sts.
It should be in the format provided below:

```json
 {
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "NotPrincipal": {
        "AWS": [
            "arn:aws:iam::<<aws-account-number>>:role/<<bucket-antivirus-role>>",
            "arn:aws:sts::<<aws-account-number>>:assumed-role/<<bucket-antivirus-role>>/<<bucket-antivirus-function>>",
            "arn:aws:iam::<<aws-account-number>>:root"
        ]
    },
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<<bucket-name>>/*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
            "s3:ExistingObjectTag/av-status": "CLEAN"
        }
    }
}
```

### Deny to download and re-tag "INFECTED" object

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObjectTagging"],
      "Principal": "*",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<<bucket-name>>/*"],
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "s3:ExistingObjectTag/av-status": "INFECTED"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Manually Scanning Buckets

You may want to scan all the objects in a bucket that have not previously been scanned or were created
prior to setting up your lambda functions. To do this you can use the `scan_bucket.py` utility.

```sh
pip install boto3
scan_bucket.py --lambda-function-name=<lambda_function_name> --s3-bucket-name=<s3-bucket-to-scan>
```

This tool will scan all objects that have not been previously scanned in the bucket and invoke the lambda function
asynchronously. As such you'll have to go to your cloudwatch logs to see the scan results or failures. Additionally,
the script uses the same environment variables you'd use in your lambda so you can configure them similarly.

## Testing

There are two types of tests in this repository. The first is pre-commit tests and the second are python tests. All of
these tests are run by CircleCI.

### pre-commit Tests

The pre-commit tests ensure that code submitted to this repository meet the standards of the repository. To get started
with these tests run `make pre_commit_install`. This will install the pre-commit tool and then install it in this
repository. Then the github pre-commit hook will run these tests before you commit your code.

To run the tests manually run `make pre_commit_tests` or `pre-commit run -a`.

### Python Tests

The python tests in this repository use `unittest` and are run via the `nose` utility. To run them you will need
to install the developer resources and then run the tests:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
make test
```

### Local lambdas

You can run the lambdas locally to test out what they are doing without deploying to AWS. This is accomplished
by using docker containers that act similarly to lambda. You will need to have set up some local variables in your
`.envrc.local` file and modify them appropriately first before running `direnv allow`. If you do not have `direnv`
it can be installed with `brew install direnv`.

For the Scan lambda you will need a test file uploaded to S3 and the variables `TEST_BUCKET` and `TEST_KEY`
set in your `.envrc.local` file. Then you can run:

```sh
direnv allow
make archive scan
```

If you want a file that will be recognized as a virus you can download a test file from the [EICAR](https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950)
website and uploaded to your bucket.

For the Update lambda you can run:

```sh
direnv allow
make archive update
```
